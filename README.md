# External HDD case for laptop (3D files)

Here’s a custom case I designed so I can easily move my MacBook around with my 2 external HDDs.

This repo contains the designs that I used but I have also included the design file (FreeCAD file) so you can modify the dimensions to suit your needs.

On a side note, I already have a FreeCAD course (in Arabic) on YouTube if you want to learn how to 3D design using the open source program FreeCAD, and here’s the link:

The design consists of a case and 2 hooks, you can attach the hooks to the case using super glue, and for an extra level of security you can add a duct tape to the opening.
